Definition-assingning to an undeclared indentifier in loose mode which creates a global variable without any declaration.
Functions are defined with the function keyword.
     function name of function (){
     
    // code to be executed
}
        

  Declaration in a function-declares the name in a function and the return type.You must declare an indentifier before you can use it.
Example;
    Let a;// if this is a declaration.
    function declaration example: function foo( ){
                                                }

Initilization-deals with the task of intilialising the contents of your data structure.Its a common practice in statically typed languages.
You can intilize a variable or property with a reference to a function.
     Let a =function () {} :       //variable
     {some object.b = function() {} ;        //object property


    Declaration in object intiliazer.
        example   obj={
                      foo() { // << This is the method declaration 
                      }       // >>
                      };
